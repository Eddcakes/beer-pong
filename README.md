## cra-bp

original base that i may want to continue with later

## server

Simple express server for interfacing with a postgres database

## tw-bp

create-react-app base using tailwindcss for styling

## live site

[live heroku app](https://pongleby.herokuapp.com/)

As trying to deploy on heroku (starting tiers) the server and client must be in one app.

- run `npm run build` in tw-bp directory and manually move over the build folder to server directory
